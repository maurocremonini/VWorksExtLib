Hello VWorkers!

The Agilent VWorks Automation Control software includes a very old JavaScript implementation of the Nescape Portable Runtime libraries that dates back to the late 1990's / early 2000's.

I think that it can be considered an implementation of the ECMAScript 3 (ES3) specifications, as [it includes RegEx, try-catch, switch and do-while](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_versions.asp). 

Having used VWorks' JS for almost ten years now I must say that it has all the most important features one may need to create useful code (functions, arrays, objects, RegExs and all their most important methods). Yet, it lacks some features that are nowadays taken for granted by all JS programmes, for example JSON support, arrow functions, destructuring assignments and many, many, many methods that can make one's code more manageable and concise.
